# Template for Micro Frontends with Module Federation

This repository template leverages the module federation paradigm to facilitate efficient code sharing across micro frontends. 

## Creating a New Micro-Frontend

Run the following command in your terminal, replacing name_of_new_project with your desired project name:

`npx degit git@github.com:jigjoy-io/module-federation-template.git#main name_of_new_project`

## Running Instructions 

To run a new micro-frontend project follow these steps:

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into your new project directory:

`cd name_of_new_project`

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

`yarn install`

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

`yarn start`

Your new micro-frontend project is now set up and running. You can start developing your application using Webpack, TypeScript, Babel, and Tailwind CSS.

## Build the Project

To build the project, run:

`yarn build`

This will create a `dist` folder where the built files will be regenerated each time you run this command.

## Tailwind

*This template includes **TailwindCSS**, a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build clean and responsive user interfaces.*
